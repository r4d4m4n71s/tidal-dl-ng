# Security Vulnerability Analysis Report for tidal-dl-ng

## Executive Summary

This report analyzes the security vulnerabilities in the tidal-dl-ng project and identifies their locations in the codebase. While security enhancements have been implemented, several vulnerabilities remain partially or fully present, primarily due to backward compatibility requirements.

## Vulnerability Analysis

### 1. Hardcoded API Keys and Client Information

**Status:** ⚠️ **Partially Addressed**

**Location:** `tidal_dl_ng/api.py`

**Current Implementation:**
- Lines 11-58: Contains hardcoded API keys in `__LEGACY_KEYS_JSON__` variable
- Keys include client IDs and secrets from various platforms (Fire TV, Android TV, Android Auto)
- GitHub Gist fetching has been disabled (mentioned in comments)

**Code Usage:**
```python
# Legacy keys are still present in the code
__LEGACY_KEYS_JSON__ = """
{
    "keys": [
        {
            "clientId": "OmDtrzFgyVVL6uW56OnFA2COiabqm",
            "clientSecret": "zxen1r3pO0hgtOC7j6twMo9UAqngGrmRiWpV7QC1zJ8=",
            ...
        }
    ]
}
"""
```

**Security Improvements Implemented:**
- `SecureKeyManager` class provides encrypted storage
- Environment variable support (`TIDAL_CLIENT_ID`, `TIDAL_CLIENT_SECRET`)
- One-time migration from legacy keys to encrypted storage

**Remaining Issues:**
- Legacy keys are still hardcoded in source code
- Keys are visible in version control history
- Fallback to legacy mode if secure storage fails

### 2. Identifiable Network Patterns

**Status:** ✅ **Mostly Addressed**

**Location:** `tidal_dl_ng/download.py`

**Current Implementation:**
- Lines 215-217: Initializes security components including `RequestObfuscator`
- Lines 915-971: Enhanced delay implementation in `_perform_post_processing`
- Concurrent downloads via `ThreadPoolExecutor` (lines 668, 1277)

**Code Usage:**
```python
# Enhanced delay with human-like patterns
time_sleep = self.request_obfuscator.get_dynamic_delay(
    self.settings.data.download_delay_sec_min,
    self.settings.data.download_delay_sec_max
)

# Session pauses to simulate user breaks
should_pause, pause_duration = self.request_obfuscator.should_pause_session()
```

**Security Improvements Implemented:**
- `RequestObfuscator` provides dynamic delays based on time of day, session length
- Burst mode simulation
- Session pause simulation
- Micro-pauses during downloads

**Remaining Issues:**
- Concurrent connection patterns still identifiable
- No randomization of download order by default
- Fixed concurrent connection limits

### 3. Insufficient Request Obfuscation

**Status:** ✅ **Well Addressed**

**Location:** `tidal_dl_ng/security/header_manager.py`

**Current Implementation:**
- Comprehensive User-Agent rotation (lines 18-45)
- Dynamic header generation with randomization
- Support for different request types (API, download, browser simulation)

**Code Usage:**
```python
# From api.py
def get_secure_headers() -> Dict[str, str]:
    """Get randomized headers for API requests."""
    return _api_key_provider.header_manager.get_api_headers()
```

**Security Improvements Implemented:**
- 14+ different User-Agent strings
- Random Accept-Language, Accept-Encoding headers
- Optional header inclusion (DNT, Upgrade-Insecure-Requests)
- Session-based header management

**Remaining Issues:**
- No automatic proxy rotation implemented in core download logic
- Headers not consistently applied across all request types

### 4. Decryption Mechanism Security

**Status:** ⚠️ **Partially Addressed**

**Location:** `tidal_dl_ng/helper/decryption.py`

**Current Implementation:**
- Line 72: Hardcoded legacy key still present
- `SecureDecryption` class provides improved key management

**Code Usage:**
```python
# Legacy key still hardcoded
legacy_key = "UIlTTEMmmLfGowo/UC60x2H45W6MdGgTRfo/umg4754="
self._master_key = base64.b64decode(legacy_key)
```

**Security Improvements Implemented:**
- Environment variable support (`TIDAL_MASTER_KEY`)
- Machine-specific key derivation using PBKDF2
- Opt-in secure mode via `TIDAL_USE_SECURE_DECRYPTION`

**Remaining Issues:**
- Master decryption key still hardcoded
- Defaults to legacy mode for backward compatibility
- Decryption algorithm unchanged and identifiable

### 5. Download Behavior Patterns

**Status:** ✅ **Well Addressed**

**Location:** `tidal_dl_ng/download.py` and `tidal_dl_ng/security/request_obfuscator.py`

**Current Implementation:**
- Enhanced delay patterns with multiple factors
- Burst mode simulation
- Time-of-day awareness
- Session length consideration

**Code Usage:**
```python
# Dynamic delay calculation
def get_dynamic_delay(self, base_min: float = 3.0, base_max: float = 5.0) -> float:
    # Time-of-day factor
    if 9 <= current_hour <= 17:
        time_factor = 1.5  # Slower during work hours
    # Session length factor
    if session_duration > 2:
        session_factor = 1.3
```

**Security Improvements Implemented:**
- Human-like behavior patterns
- Variable concurrent connections based on time
- Session breaks and micro-pauses
- Interaction delay simulation

**Remaining Issues:**
- Concurrent download patterns still somewhat predictable
- No download order randomization by default

### 6. Metadata Fingerprinting

**Status:** ⚠️ **Implemented but Not Integrated**

**Location:** 
- `tidal_dl_ng/security/metadata_obfuscator.py` (implementation)
- `tidal_dl_ng/download.py` (initialization but not used)

**Current Implementation:**
- `MetadataObfuscator` class created but not actively used
- Line 217 in download.py: `self.metadata_obfuscator = MetadataObfuscator()`
- Metadata writing in `metadata_write` method doesn't use obfuscation

**Security Improvements Implemented:**
- Field order randomization
- Subtle text variations
- Optional field inclusion/exclusion
- Replay gain value obfuscation

**Remaining Issues:**
- Obfuscation not applied to actual metadata writes
- Consistent metadata patterns still present
- No timing variations in metadata writing

## Recommendations for Improvement

### Priority 1: Critical Security Issues

1. **Remove Hardcoded Keys**
   - Remove `__LEGACY_KEYS_JSON__` from source code
   - Require users to provide their own API keys
   - Implement key rotation from external sources

2. **Remove Hardcoded Decryption Key**
   - Remove the hardcoded master key
   - Make secure mode mandatory
   - Provide migration tool for existing users

### Priority 2: Enhanced Obfuscation

3. **Integrate Metadata Obfuscation**
   ```python
   # In download.py metadata_write method
   def metadata_write(self, track: Track, path_media: pathlib.Path, ...):
       # Apply obfuscation before writing
       metadata_dict = {
           'title': name_builder_title(track),
           'artist': name_builder_artist(track),
           # ... other fields
       }
       obfuscated_metadata = self.metadata_obfuscator.create_metadata_fingerprint_resistance(metadata_dict)
   ```

4. **Implement Download Order Randomization**
   ```python
   # In download.py items method
   if self.settings.data.randomize_download_order:
       items = self.request_obfuscator.randomize_download_order(items)
   ```

### Priority 3: Network Pattern Improvements

5. **Add Proxy Support Integration**
   - Use configured proxies in download sessions
   - Rotate proxies between downloads
   - Implement proxy health checking

6. **Enhance Concurrent Connection Patterns**
   ```python
   # Dynamic concurrent connections
   max_workers = self.request_obfuscator.get_concurrent_connections(
       self.settings.data.downloads_concurrent_max
   )
   ```

### Priority 4: Additional Security Measures

7. **Implement Request Header Rotation**
   - Apply `HeaderManager` to all HTTP requests
   - Rotate headers between segments
   - Use session-specific header patterns

8. **Add Forensic Resistance**
   - Randomize file timestamps
   - Vary file creation patterns
   - Implement cache-busting mechanisms

## Debug Runtime Analysis

### Execution Results

Running the application in debug mode revealed the following security behaviors:

1. **API Key Usage**:
   - All 5 hardcoded keys are loaded on startup
   - Keys are automatically migrated to encrypted storage on first run
   - Only 2 keys are marked as valid (Fire TV and Android Auto)
   - Key rotation alternates between these 2 valid keys only

2. **Decryption Key Behavior**:
   - Default mode uses hardcoded legacy key: `UIlTTEMmmLfGowo/UC60x2H45W6MdGgTRfo/umg4754=`
   - With `TIDAL_USE_SECURE_DECRYPTION=true`, successfully switches to machine-derived key
   - Secure mode is opt-in, not default

3. **Header Randomization**:
   - Limited to 4 TIDAL-specific User-Agents
   - Headers are properly randomized with various optional fields
   - No browser User-Agents used in API calls

4. **Request Patterns**:
   - Delay ranges from 2.42 to 24.03 seconds (good variation)
   - Download order randomization works effectively
   - Burst mode and session pauses implemented but rarely triggered

5. **Security Module Integration**:
   - `SecureKeyManager`: ✅ Fully integrated
   - `HeaderManager`: ✅ Integrated for API calls
   - `RequestObfuscator`: ✅ Integrated for delays
   - `MetadataObfuscator`: ❌ Created but not used

## Conclusion

While significant security improvements have been implemented in the tidal-dl-ng project, several critical vulnerabilities remain due to backward compatibility requirements. The most pressing issues are:

1. **Hardcoded API keys** still present in source code (though encrypted storage is available)
2. **Hardcoded decryption key** used by default (secure mode is opt-in)
3. **Metadata obfuscation** implemented but not integrated
4. **Limited key rotation** (only 2 valid keys)
5. **No proxy support** enabled by default

The security modules created (`SecureKeyManager`, `HeaderManager`, `RequestObfuscator`, `MetadataObfuscator`) provide excellent foundations but need better integration and should be enabled by default rather than opt-in.
