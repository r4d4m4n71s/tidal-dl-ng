# Security Vulnerability Analysis Report for tidal-dl-ng

## Executive Summary

This report analyzes the security vulnerabilities identified in the tidal-dl-ng application and provides a comprehensive list of improvements. The analysis covers the location of vulnerabilities in the codebase, how they are currently being exploited, and recommended remediation strategies.

## Vulnerability Analysis

### 1. Hardcoded API Keys and Client Information

#### Location in Code:
- **File**: `tidal_dl_ng/api.py`
- **Lines**: 43-78 (API_KEYS list)
- **Function**: `login()` method (lines 129-189)

#### Current Usage:
```python
# In api.py
API_KEYS = [
    {
        "platform": "Android",
        "client_id": "dN2N95wCyEBTllu4",
        "client_secret": "3BI4uzYBYpmdtpOXUSZpHZYcmFPCz16fG+Fq2hCgdXU=",
        # ... more hardcoded keys
    }
]
```

The application:
- Stores API keys as plain text constants
- Fetches additional keys from GitHub Gist: `https://api.github.com/gists/48d01f5a24b4b7b37f19443977c22cd6`
- Uses these keys directly in authentication requests
- No obfuscation or encryption of keys in transit

#### Security Impact:
- Keys are easily extractable from source code
- GitHub Gist fetching creates a single point of failure
- Service can track and block these known keys

### 2. Identifiable Network Patterns

#### Location in Code:
- **File**: `tidal_dl_ng/download.py`
- **Lines**: 207-209 (TODO comment about timing randomization)
- **Function**: `_download_tracks()` (lines 267-296)

#### Current Usage:
```python
# In download.py
# TODO: Randomize download timing to avoid detection patterns
```

The application:
- Downloads files in predictable sequential order
- Uses fixed concurrent connection counts
- No randomization of request timing between downloads
- Creates easily identifiable traffic spikes

#### Security Impact:
- Traffic analysis can identify tidal-dl-ng usage
- Service can implement rate limiting based on patterns

### 3. Insufficient Request Obfuscation

#### Location in Code:
- **File**: `tidal_dl_ng/api.py`
- **Lines**: 86-88 (User-Agent definition)
- **Function**: `_create_session()` (lines 103-108)

#### Current Usage:
```python
# Fixed User-Agent
self.s.headers.update({
    "User-Agent": "TIDAL/3506 CFNetwork/1485 Darwin/23.1.0",
})
```

The application:
- Uses a single, fixed User-Agent string
- No header rotation or variation
- No proxy support implementation
- Headers remain constant across all requests

#### Security Impact:
- Easy to fingerprint and block specific User-Agent
- IP-based tracking and blocking possible

### 4. Decryption Mechanism Security

#### Location in Code:
- **File**: `tidal_dl_ng/helper/decryption.py`
- **Lines**: 13-14 (Master key definition)
- **Function**: `decrypt_security_token()` and `decrypt_file()`

#### Current Usage:
```python
# Hardcoded master key
MASTER_KEY = "UIlTTEMmmLfGowo/UC60x2H45W6MdGgTRfo/umg4754="
```

The application:
- Uses a publicly known master decryption key
- Standard AES decryption algorithm
- No key rotation or derivation

#### Security Impact:
- Decryption mechanism is well-known and documented
- Service could change encryption methods to break compatibility

### 5. Download Behavior Patterns

#### Location in Code:
- **File**: `tidal_dl_ng/download.py`
- **Function**: `_download_delay()` (lines 192-203)
- **Config**: `download_delay` setting usage

#### Current Usage:
```python
def _download_delay(self) -> None:
    """Apply download delay if configured."""
    delay_range = self.cfg.data.download_delay
    if delay_range:
        min_delay, max_delay = delay_range
        delay = random.uniform(min_delay, max_delay)
        time.sleep(delay)
```

The application:
- Simple random delay between fixed boundaries
- No consideration for time of day or session patterns
- Concurrent downloads create identifiable patterns

#### Security Impact:
- Delays are too uniform and predictable
- Doesn't mimic real human behavior effectively

### 6. Metadata Fingerprinting

#### Location in Code:
- **File**: `tidal_dl_ng/metadata.py`
- **Functions**: `write_metadata()`, `write_lyrics()`
- Consistent metadata writing patterns

#### Current Usage:
The application:
- Writes metadata in the same order every time
- Uses consistent formatting and capitalization
- No variation in optional fields
- Fixed timing patterns for metadata operations

#### Security Impact:
- Downloaded files have consistent fingerprints
- Metadata patterns can be traced back to the tool
