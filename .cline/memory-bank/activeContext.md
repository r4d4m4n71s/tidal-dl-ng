## Recent Changes & Evolution

### Major Refactoring Work Completed
- **Proxy Method Consolidation**: Moved `test_proxy_connectivity()` and `get_proxy_status()` from config.py to proxy.py
- **Class Renaming**: Renamed `ProxyEnhancedTidalSession` to `EnhancedTidalSession` across entire codebase
- **Code Deduplication**: Eliminated duplicate proxy methods, improved separation of concerns
- **pyproject.toml Improvements**: Created comprehensive improvements including PEP 621 migration and enhanced metadata

### Authentication Flow Analysis
- **LocalAuthServer**: Complete OAuth 2.0 flow with local HTTP server for callback handling
- **Simple OAuth**: Device linking authentication with proxy support
- **Token-based Login**: Direct token authentication for existing sessions
- **Priority System**: Maintains authentication method priority in config.py

### Files Modified in Recent Session
- **tidal_dl_ng/proxy.py**: Enhanced ProxyManager with comprehensive status methods
- **tidal_dl_ng/config.py**: Removed duplicate methods, updated imports and class references
- **tidal_dl_ng/enhanced_session.py**: Renamed class, updated method delegation
- **tidal_dl_ng/tidal_proxy_integration.py**: Updated type annotations and function signatures
- **tests/test_integration.py**: Updated method calls and imports
- **pyproject.toml.improved**: Created with PEP 621 compliance and enhanced configuration

## Next Steps & Priorities

### Immediate Development Focus
1. **Test Creation**: Create comprehensive tests for config login method covering all authentication scenarios
2. **Authentication Testing**: Test token-based login, local server auth, proxy-enhanced device linking
3. **Mock Implementation**: Create mock objects and fixtures for authentication testing
4. **Code Coverage**: Expand test coverage for recently refactored components

### Memory Bank Maintenance
- **Documentation Updates**: Keep memory bank current with refactoring changes
- **Pattern Documentation**: Record new architectural decisions from recent refactoring
- **Progress Tracking**: Maintain accurate status of completed refactoring work

## Active Decisions & Considerations

### Recent Architectural Improvements
- **Separation of Concerns**: Proxy methods now properly located in ProxyManager class
- **Class Naming**: EnhancedTidalSession provides clearer naming without proxy prefix
- **Method Delegation**: Enhanced session delegates proxy operations to dedicated proxy manager
- **Code Organization**: Eliminated duplication between config.py and proxy.py

### Authentication Architecture
- **Multiple Auth Methods**: Support for OAuth server, device linking, and token-based authentication
- **Priority System**: Maintains fallback chain for different authentication scenarios
- **Proxy Integration**: Enhanced session seamlessly integrates proxy functionality
- **Session Management**: Clean separation between authentication and proxy concerns

### Development Environment
- **Python Version**: Strict 3.12 requirement maintained for latest features
- **Dependencies**: Balancing feature richness vs minimal dependency footprint
- **Optional Components**: GUI components as optional extras for flexible installation
- **Build System**: Modern Poetry with pyproject.toml improvements implemented

## Important Patterns & Preferences

### Code Style Standards
- **Line Length**: 120 characters (configured in black, ruff)
- **Import Organization**: isort with black profile for consistency
- **Type Annotations**: mypy strict mode enforced throughout codebase
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive exception handling with user-friendly messages

### Development Workflow
- **GUI Development**: Qt Designer → .ui files → pyside6-uic → Python modules
- **Build Process**: Poetry for dependency management, Makefile for build automation
- **Quality Gates**: pre-commit hooks, comprehensive linting, security scanning

### User Experience Priorities
- **CLI Efficiency**: Single commands for common operations
- **GUI Usability**: Progressive disclosure, clear progress feedback
- **Cross-platform**: Consistent experience across Windows, macOS, Linux
- **Performance**: Optimized for large downloads with progress visibility

## Learning & Project Insights

### Recent Refactoring Insights
- **Code Duplication**: Identified and eliminated duplicate proxy methods between modules
- **Class Naming**: Clear, descriptive class names improve code readability and maintainability
- **Method Delegation**: Proper delegation patterns reduce coupling and improve testability
- **Authentication Complexity**: Multiple authentication flows require careful coordination

### Technical Strengths
- **Modern Python**: Leverages latest Python 3.12 features effectively
- **Clean Architecture**: Recent refactoring further improved separation of concerns
- **Performance Focus**: Multithreading and chunking optimize download experience
- **Quality Standards**: Comprehensive tooling ensures code quality
- **Proxy Integration**: Seamless proxy support enhances global accessibility

### Project Maturity Indicators
- **Active Community**: Regular contributions and issue discussions
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive README with usage examples
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions for automated testing and releases
- **Distribution**: Multiple installation methods (pip, binaries, source)
- **Code Quality**: Recent refactoring demonstrates commitment to maintainability

### Development Environment Insights
- **Tooling Integration**: Poetry, pre-commit, and quality tools work seamlessly
- **Build System**: Modern Python packaging standards with enhanced pyproject.toml
- **Cross-platform**: Thoughtful handling of platform differences
- **Testing Strategy**: Need for comprehensive authentication testing identified
